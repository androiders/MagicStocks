## MagicStocks

##What is it?
MagicStocks is an application to do simple technical analysis on stock data. The initial goal is to use it for a strategy called Magic-K which gives buy and sell signals for a stock accorfing to the Fast k(2,3) measurement.

It is written in c++ using Qt and those are pretty much the only requirements. Stock data is fetcehd from Yahoo finance public tables (with the limitations that comes with that). 

Currently MagicStocks is in early development.
